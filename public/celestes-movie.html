<h1>The Best movies According to Celeste</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Maleficent</h3>
<p>
  Maleficent is based on the evil fairy godmother character in Charles
  Perrault's fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, as well as the villainess who appears
  in the Brothers Grimm's retelling of the story, Little Briar Rose. You try not
  love this villian but you cant help but feel the pain she goes through and
  agree as to why she does what she does.

<h3>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</h3>
<p>
  Maleficent alienates herself from Aurora when she opposes her engagement with
  Prince Phillip. Unknown to them, an enemy lurks, waiting to capitalise on
  their discord and destroy all that they love.
</p>
<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>
  Ajax, a twisted scientist, experiments on Wade Wilson, a mercenary, to cure
  him of cancer and give him healing powers. However, the experiment leaves Wade
  disfigured and he decides to exact revenge. The way Ryan Reynolds plays the
  role of Wade Wilson is on point. The sarcasm and humor along with the sadness
  is a beautiful balance. Its a movie that you can never get enough of.
